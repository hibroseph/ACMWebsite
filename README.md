# ACMWebsite
## History
... Well, Joe here. This is my attempt to learn some ASP.NET MVC. I happened to want to do this right when we were deciding on projects for ACM. Just happens that a web framework was needed so I thought, why not. I could have some results of a website in 14ish weeks.

## Start here
1. Clone the repo
2. Open repo up in Visual Studio
3. Go to Debug > Start without Debugging
4. Make sure website loads locally so you can see changes
5. Make changes, make sure they work.
6. Commit and push changes
7. Tell Crew to make sure it is working
8. Finish website
9. Profit

## Roles
* Joe - Backend
* Bradley - Frontend
