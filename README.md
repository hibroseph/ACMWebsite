# ACMWebsite
## History
... Well, Joe here. This is my attempt to learn some ASP.NET MVC. I happened to want to do this right when we were deciding on projects for ACM. Just happens that a web framework was needed so I thought, why not. I could have some results of a website in 14ish weeks.

## Start here
1. I'd say clone this repo and try your best
2. Ask Joe for questions
3. Finish Website

## Roles
* Joe - Backend
* Bradley - Frontend
* Cory - Where ever he wants to be
